===================
### A collection of projects created for CS 313E at The University of Texas at Austin. Fall 2020.

This code is intended for educational purposes and to serve as a guide for those looking to review Python data structures / algorithms.

This code should __not__ be plagiarized. Do the work and you'll be a *computing* science king / queen.

Much of this code was written with Matthew Molinar following the [Pair Programming](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Kindergarten.PDF) model.
